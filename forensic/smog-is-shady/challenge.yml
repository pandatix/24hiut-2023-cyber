  We have conducted a raid at the home of an individual who seem to be planning a bad move. We were able to seize his computer, you will find a copy of the disk.
  We count on you to find information that would allow us to take action in time. Maybe a date or a location ? In short, hurry up.
  P.S.: our agents have been working on a dictionary that could help you if you encounter difficulties.
